DIRECTORIES OVERVIEW

/bin		Location for completed builds
/lib		Directory to search for library dependencies
/include       	Include directory for library headers
/source      	Source code for building Laverna's Brute
/tools          Useful tools meant to assist developers

BUILDING:

Currently, the only dependency for building Laverna's Brute is Boost 1.38 or later. The required header files can be
found at http://boost.org/. Pre-built Boost libraries are available at http://dottru.net/~joseph/BoostLibs/

If using pre-built libraries, you must include the Boost headers matching the version of your built libraries.

Extract the /boost directory of your Boost archive to lavernasbrute/include/. Extract the archive of pre-built
Boost libraries to lavernasbrute/lib/.

	-- Windows --

	Install GCC through Cygwin or MinGW and follow the UNIX instructions.

	-- UNIX (Linux, OS X, BSD) --	

	Build Boost, copy the headers to /include, and the libraries to /lib.
	
	Move to the directory in which you've checked out the Laverna's Brute source code, and run "make".
	
	To build for a different architecture, specify ARCH after the make command.

	For example, to build for the 64-bit x86 archtecture, run "make ARCH=x86-64".

	NOTE: your processor must support the SSE2 instruction set to use the SSE2 path.

----------

NOTE: Windows builds of Laverna's Brute are no longer supported. Linux systems offer much better performance
than Windows. Consequently, Windows support has been dropped.
