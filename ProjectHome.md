_"In Roman mythology, Laverna was a goddess of Thieves, Cheats and the underworld. She was propitiated by libations poured with the left hand. The poet Horace and the playwright Plautus call her a goddess of thieves."_

Laverna's Brute:

An open source hash cracker leveraging the power of heterogeneous computing systems to provide a portable, flexible, and high performance application with the goal of reversing the largest percentage of hashed text strings feasible. Laverna's Brute has been created from the ground up to be the worker application for a distributed cracking network named Laverna. Future plans are to create such a network that will be free for use, provided users donate the required amount of processing time per target to be cracked.
