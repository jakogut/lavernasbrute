DIRECTORIES OVERVIEW

/bin		Location for completed builds
/lib		Directory to search for library dependencies
/include       	Include directory for library headers
/source      	Source code for building Laverna's Brute
/tools          Useful tools meant to assist developers

BUILDING:

Install the dependencies specified in [lavernasbrute_root]/DEPENDENCIES either with your system's package manager,
or manually. (If compiling on Windows, the dependencies will need to be installed manually.)

	-- Windows --

	Install GCC through Cygwin or MinGW and follow the UNIX instructions.

	-- UNIX (Linux, OS X, BSD) --	

	Build Boost, copy the headers to /include, and the libraries to /lib.
	
	Move to the directory in which you've checked out the Laverna's Brute source code, and run "make".
	
	To build for a different architecture, specify ARCH after the make command.

	For example, to build for the 64-bit x86 archtecture, run "make ARCH=x86-64".

NOTE: Your processor must support the SSE/SSE2 instruction set to use the SSE path.
The SSE path must be explicitly enabled during a build by defining "SSE". This can be
done in "Version.h".
