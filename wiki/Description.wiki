#Project Description and Goals

= Introduction =

The aim of this project is to provide a free (in both senses) implementation of a brute-force password cracker. The first goal is to successfully crack a windows password of any length. After this has been completed, I can add support for GPGPU acceleration, and after that's completed, I can add support for the cracking of other passwords, such as WEP/WPA keys.

= Milestones: =

    *  Random generation of strings for use in a brute forcer    *Completed*
    *  Threading support    *Completed*

    *  Support for cracking of Windows passwords
        *  Extract LM/NTLM hashes *Completed*
        *  Re-create one-way hash function *Partial*
        *  Pass random strings through hash function until a match is found

    *  GPGPU Acceleration

= Current Speed: =
(IPS == iterations per second.)

Core 2 Duo 2.00 ghz (T7300)

    * No hash-generation, four character string. 
        * Estimated time: < 30 sec
        * ~700,000 ips

    * No hash-generation, five character string. 
        * Estimated time: < 10 min
        * ~600,000 ips

    * No hash-generation, six character string.
        * Estimated time: < 4 hr
        * ~500,000 ips
