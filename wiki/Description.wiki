#Project Description and Goals

= Introduction =

The aim of this project is to provide a free (in both senses) implementation of a brute-force password cracker. The first goal is to successfully crack a windows password of any length. After this has been completed, I can add support for GPGPU acceleration, and after that's completed, I can add support for the cracking of other passwords, such as WEP/WPA keys.

= Milestones: =

    *  Random generation of strings for use in a brute forcer    *Complete*
    *  Threading support    *Complete*

    *  Support for cracking of Windows passwords
        *  Extract LM/NTLM hashes *Complete*
        *  Re-create one-way hash function *Complete*

    *  Support for cracking of network authentication keys
        
    *  `*`NIX Support *Complete*

    *  Rainbow Tables

    *  Alternative Processing Paths:
        *  ATI (Stream) processing path *Partial*
        *  NVIDIA (CUDA) processing path
        *  Networked load distribution/coordination (Project Vesta)
        

= Speed Tests: =

_Due to the constantly changing nature of the performance of Laverna's Brute, speed testing has been reserved for milestone builds only, and out-of-date speed tests have been deleted._
