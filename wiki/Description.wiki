#Project Description and Goals

= Introduction =

The aim of this project is to provide a free (in both senses) implementation of a brute-force password cracker. The first goal is to successfully crack a windows password of any length. After this has been completed, I can add support for GPGPU acceleration, and after that's completed, I can add support for the cracking of other passwords, such as WEP/WPA keys.

= Milestones: =

    *  Random generation of strings for use in a brute forcer    *Completed*
    *  Threading support    *Completed*

    *  Support for cracking of Windows passwords
        *  Extract LM/NTLM hashes *Completed*
        *  Re-create one-way hash function *Partial*
        
    *  GPGPU Acceleration (ATI/Stream)
    *  NIX Support

    *  GPGPU Acceleration (Nvidia/CUDA)

= Current Speed: =
(IPS == iterations per second.)

Core 2 Duo 2.00 ghz (T7300)

    * No hash-generation, four character string. 
        * Estimated time: < 6 sec
        * ~2.5 million ips

(OUTDATED RESULTS)
    * No hash-generation, five character string. 
        * Estimated time: < 10 min
        * ~600,000 ips

(OUTDATED RESULTS)
    * No hash-generation, six character string.
        * Estimated time: < 4 hr
        * ~500,000 ips

These are informal tests. Complete accuracy is not guaranteed, but the results were estimated to the best of my ability. Results were averaged when practical, estimated time was rounded up, and iterations per second was rounded down.
