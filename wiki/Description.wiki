= Introduction =

The aim of this project is to provide a free (in both senses) implementation of a brute-force password cracker with support for a variety of distributed and parallel computing platforms, including GPGPU and networked load distribution.

= Milestones: =

    * Threading support *Complete*

    * Support for cracking of Windows passwords *Complete*

    * Support for cracking of network authentication keys
        
    * `*`NIX Support *Complete*

    * Rainbow Tables

    * Alternative Processing Paths:
        *  ATI (Stream) processing path *Partial*
        *  NVIDIA (CUDA) processing path
        *  Networked load distribution/coordination

    * Persistent runs (Saving/loading of progress in a run)

= Release Labels: =

== Development Releases: ==
    === Alpha ===  

        * Most unstable form of development release

        * Feature list is not frozen, and new bugs/regressions may be introduced at any time

        * Intended feature list is not complete

    === Beta ===

        * A step up in stability from Alpha

        * Feature list for a given release is, for the most part, completed

        * Code changes are primarily bug fixes

    === Release Candidate ===

    * RC builds have potential to be release builds, but are still potentially unstable

    * Feature list is frozen, no new features may be introduced in this stage

    * Bug fixes only

== Release Builds: ==

Once a certain release has passed the RC stage, and has been deemed stable, it will be compiled and binaries for a number of platforms will be hosted here.

There are no current release builds for Laverna's Brute.

= Speed Tests: =

_Due to the constantly changing nature of the performance of Laverna's Brute, speed testing has been reserved for milestone builds only, and out-of-date speed tests have been deleted._
