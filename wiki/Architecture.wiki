#summary A general synopsis of the architecture and inner workings of Laverna's Brute.

= Introduction =

Laverna's Brute is an advanced hash-cracking application built on top of a massively parallel computational engine. The engine provides easy access to a number of processing paths, and structures it in a way that is easy to understand and extend. As of now, the engine supports threading, and an early implementation of GPGPU. It can, and will be extended with full support for GPGPU paths, and distributed computing over a variety of platforms and architectures.

TODO: Explain the computing engine in more detail, and provide information as to the differences between Laverna's Brute, and the engine.
