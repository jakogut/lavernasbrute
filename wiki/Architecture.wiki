= Introduction =

Laverna's Brute is an advanced hash-cracking application built on top of a massively parallel computational engine. The engine provides easy access to a number of processing paths, and structures it in a way that is easy to understand and extend.

== Laverna's Brute ==

The code specific to Laverna's Brute is specialized in hash-cracking. The real power of the cracker lies in the processing engine powering it.

== Processing Engine ==

The Laverna's Brute processing engine utilizes a number of methods for parallel computation on a single machine, such as threading and SIMD operations, which are meant to use as much power available, as efficiently as possible. The engine is planned to be extended with support for organized distributed computing over a network.
