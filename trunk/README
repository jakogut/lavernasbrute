BUILDING

The environment is automatically set up to include the necessary headers,
but you will need to manually extract the required libraries for your 
compiler, which are archived and available for download at http://lavernasbrute.googlecode.com.
Extract the contents of the archive containing the pre-built libraries 
for your compiler/architecture to the /lib folder.

You will need to install the ATI Stream SDK for your platform, which is available here: http://developer.amd.com/gpu/ATIStreamSDK/


The currently supported architectures and compilers are:

[OS]	[Compiler]			[Arch]

Win	Visual Studio C++ 9.0	(x86/x64)


Pre-built libraries are available for:

[OS]	[Compiler]			[Arch]		[Build Profile]		[Library Type]

Win	Visual Studio C++ 9.0	(x86/x64)		Release & Debug		Static Only
Win	Intel C++ Compiler		(x86)		Release	& Debug		Static Only	(Unsupported)
Lin	GCC			(x86)		Release			Static Only	(Unsupported)


To compile the project on Windows, open the Visual Studio solution file in
the /MSVC9 directory and build.
