The environment is automatically set up to include the necessary headers,
but you will need to manually extract the required libraries for your 
compiler, which are archived in the "lib" folder. Extract the contents of
the archive containing the pre-built libraries for your compiler/architecture
to the /lib folder.



The currently supported architectures and compilers are:

[OS]	[Compiler]		[Arch]

Win	Visual Studio C++ 	(x86/x64)	
Win	Intel C++ Compiler	(x86)



Pre-built libraries are available for:

[OS]	[Compiler]		[Arch]		[Build Profile]		[Library Type]

Win	Visual Studio C++	(x64)		Release & Debug		Static Only
Win	Intel C++ Compiler	(x86)		Release & Debug		Static Only




To compile the project on Windows, open the Visual Studio solution file in
the /msvc directory and build.
