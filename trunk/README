BUILDING:

Currently, the only dependency for building Laverna's Brute is Boost 1.38 or later. The required header files can be
found at http://boost.org/. Pre-built Boost libraries are available at http://dottru.net/~joseph/BoostLibs/

If using pre-built libraries, you must include the Boost headers matching the version of your built libraries.

Extract the /boost directory of your Boost archive to lavernasbrute/include/. Extract the archive of pre-built
Boost libraries to lavernasbrute/lib/.

	-- Windows --

	To compile the project on Windows, open the Visual Studio solution file in
	the /MSVC9 directory and build. 

	-- Linux --	
	
	Move to the directory in which you've checked out the Laverna's Brute source code, and run "make".

Pre-built libraries are available for:

[OS]			[Compiler]			[Arch]		[Build Profile]		[Library Type]

Windows			Visual Studio C++ 9.0		(x86/x64)	Release & Debug		Complete
Windows			Intel C++ Compiler 11.0		(x86/x64)	Release	& Debug		Complete
Linux			GCC 4.x				(x64)		Release	& Debug		Complete

NOTE: Windows builds of Laverna's Brute are no longer supported. Linux systems offer much better performance
than Windows. Consequently, Windows support has been dropped.
